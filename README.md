When a player connect 5 in a row, the player wins.

## Wireframes:

## Technologies Used:

    - HTML
    - CSS
    - JavaScript

## Approach:

I tried to make every image file a section of a grid and everytime you click on the section of the image (intersection of the grid), the picture will change to a black stone or white stone depending on what color your stone is.

But after trying many hours on the project, I couldn't figure out to implement the winning condition.

So I started use the tic-tac-toe exercise. I went from 3x3 to 4x4, 5x5, all the way to 13 x 13 grid.
However, I couldn't get

However, I couldn't get image files to appear on the grid until Adonis helped me on 1/8.
I was still facing problems, so as a last resort I made a version 2 with winning condition.

Instead of having an image file for every grid, I just made a whole gameboard background, and made the grid transparent.

I got the winning conditions to work, but I hate the fact that I just substituted over the tic-tac-toe lab.

## Challenges:

Lack of my creativity, and architecturally, I didn't plan anything out right. So I kept running through problems line after line.

## Additional information:

A lot of the code is from Adonis and Tosin's tic-tac-toe lab code.
